## Potential System Addition

    ### Irrigation System
        
        On the more difficult side of the system addition will be the implementation of an irrigation system. Ultimately what should this system be able to do? In short, this certain system allows the individual maintaining the greenhouse to set the watering of crops/plants to be either more automatic, or able to do it at the push of a button. While there are multiple ways to go about this system, whether it may be via pvc pipes or through a system called drip irrigation. The components is completely connected to the type of system that is being used. For instance some of the components can be listed as (System using pvc pipes):
            1. PVC pipes, x feet amount 
                (to flow water through rooms, desired size)
            2. PVC couplings (connector) x amount
                (able to connect the pipes together)
            3. PVC adapter x amount
                (allows pvc pipe to connect to water hoses)
            4. PVC elbows x amount
                (gives access to cut corners)
            5. PVC primer and cemet
                (able to clean and "glue" together the system)
            6. (Maybe) Can implement a makeshift drain adapter
                (allows to drain the system in case of issue)
        To make more automatic can implement the following:
            6. PCV T-elbow x amount
                (2-ends can meet while extending anpther route)
            7. PVC end cap x amount
                (cut off the end of routes)
            8. PVC micro-sprayers
                (allows water to be outputted in a spray-like manner)
            9. Following 8. in order to install the   micro-sprayer drill bits are needed to make the wholes (certain sizes are needed)
            10. Stepper motor x amount
                (to direct certain plants an excessive amount of stepper motors might be needed)
            11. PVC cutouts that'll fit inside the pipes
                (act as cut-offs to direct the water)
        
        There are other things to consider, such as:
            - Heating tape
                depending on the state of the outer environment, this will act so that the water within the pipes won't freeze
                (Though if freezing temperatures is a rare case, then these are not needed)
            - External pesticide tank
                Though might be rare, there might be a chance that pests invade the greenhouse environment 
                so pesticide might be needed. But this will contaminate most of the plants so safety procaution is needed.
